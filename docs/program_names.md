#### TurtleCoin program references  

CyprusCoin is a fork of TurtleCoin.  The names there are confusing, so over here we are simplyfing it as follows.

CyprusCoind = TurtleCoind   
CyprusCoinw = wallet-api  
cyprus-service-eol = turtle-service  
CyprusCoin-zedwallet = zedwallet  
CyprusCoin-zedwallet-beta = zedwallet-beta  

Refer to the top of the doc about what each program does and where to find docs if there are any.
